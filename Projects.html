<h2>My Favorite Projects at NIU!</h2>

    <h2>Database Project</h2>
    <p>This was a very fun project for me in because I got to pretty much make it my own.  I got to build a database from scratch and write really interesting queries for it. So this was definetly my favorite part of OMIS 452.

    <h2>Visualization Project</h2>
    <p>This project was done in Tableau, and it was my first experience with turning big data into visuals. This project my group went to Kaggle.com and we got a data set about the NBA.  With this data we were able to use players statistics to see how likely it would be for them to win player of the week.
